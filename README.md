# PlatformIO ESP-ADF example

## Description

See https://community.platformio.org/t/esp32-adf-audio-dev-framework-please-help/

## Building

Look into the `platformio.ini` to understand how building works and what you have to change.

If you do not at least change an include path from the `build_unflags` settings, the firmware will not
compile! 

## License 

All of the ESP-ADF code is a momentary snapshot of the repo (https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf/) on the
27.04.2019 **with the latest ESP-IDF**. That's right, not the 6 month old ESP-IDF version ESP-ADF uses right now
.
